<p>The openVirus project aims to aggregate information relating to viruses and epidemics from scholarly publications. As there are a number of related projects already (e.g. these COVID-19 search engines), the openVirus project wants to focus on more novel tools and on data sources that are being under-utilised.</p>

<p>One such under-utilised data source is doctoral theses, which can include far more context and commentary than journal artices[1].</p>

<p>The EThOS service provides electronic access to UK theses. Through the web interface, users can search the metadata and abstracts of over half a million theses. Furthermore, to support data mining and analysis, the EThOS metadata has been published as a dataset. This dataset includes links to institutional repository pages for many of the theses.</p>

<p>This data source can be fed into the UK Web Archive tools to collect and index the full-text of these theses. We can then build a simple faceted search interface and perform some basic data mining operations. This should allow relevant documents to be found so that they can be analysed using the openVirus tools.</p>
